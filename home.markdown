I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, advised by <a href="https://yoseflab.github.io/" target="_blank">Nir Yosef</a> and 
<a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a>.

I work in the fields of computational biology and machine learning. The primary focus of my research is the development of novel unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods for capturing hidden signals arising from heterogeneous and high-dimensional genomic datasets.
<!--I work on developing models and methods for advancing the analysis and interpretation of genomic data. A primary focus of my research is the development of novel unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods for capturing hidden signals arising from complex and high-dimensional genomic datasets, while providing statistically sound methods for testing hypotheses in order to gain biological insights.

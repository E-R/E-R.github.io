I am an Assistant Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computational Medicine at UCLA. I work in the fields of computational biology and machine learning. The primary focus of my research is the development of novel machine-learning methods and statistical models for capturing hidden signals from high-dimensional genomic and clinical data for enabling robust and replicable analysis in the presence of unknown confounding effects. 

Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, where I worked with <a href="https://yoseflab.github.io/" target="_blank">Nir Yosef</a> and <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a>. I earned my PhD in Computer Science at UCLA, where I worked with <a href="https://www.eranhalperingenomics.com" target="_blank">Eran Halperin</a>, and my MSc in Computer Science and BSc in Computer Science and Biology at Tel Aviv University.
